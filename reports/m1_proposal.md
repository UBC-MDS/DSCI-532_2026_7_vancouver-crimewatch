# Proposal - Vancouver Crime Watch

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- **Our Role**: Data Science Consultants
- **Target Audience**: Newcomers to Vancouver (students, families, immigrants, and professionals relocating to the city)

Moving to a new city can be overwhelming, especially when individuals are unfamiliar with neighborhood characteristics and overall safety conditions. For newcomers to Vancouver, choosing where to live is one of the most important early decisions they make. However, without local knowledge, it can be difficult to assess which areas align with their safety expectations and comfort levels.
Finding reliable, easy-to-understand safety information is often challenging, as data may be technical, or not presented in a way that supports practical decision-making. This uncertainty can lead to stress, uninformed housing choices, or dissatisfaction after moving in.

To address this challenge, we propose the **Vancouver Safety Dashboard (VSD)**, an interactive data visualization application designed to provide clear and accessible insights into neighborhood safety trends across Vancouver. The dashboard will allow users to explore safety-related indicators by area, compare neighborhoods, and filter data by categories such as incident type or time period.

By transforming complex public safety data into intuitive visual insights, our app empowers newcomers to make informed housing decisions, feel more confident in their relocation process, and select neighborhoods that best align with their personal safety preferences and lifestyle needs.

## Section 2: Description of the Data
Describe the dataset you finalized in Step 1.

Stats: Number of rows/columns.
Relevance: How variables potentially link to the problem.

## Section 3: Research Questions & Usage Scenarios
Detail how the audience will interact with the app.

Persona: Brief description of a user.
Usage Scenario create a narrative describing user needs and context.
User Stories / JTBD: Provide at least 3 User Stories or Job Stories that outline specific tasks the user needs to perform.

## Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Demonstrate that your data can actually support your user stories.

Select one of your User Stories/JTBD from Section 3.
Create a Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder (e.g., notebooks/eda_analysis.ipynb).
Create 1-2 static visualizations or summary tables that directly address the user's task.
In your proposal document (this section), briefly explain what the visualization shows and how comparing these values specifically supports the user's decision-making.
(Include the relevant plots or a link to the notebook in this section).


## Section 5: App Sketch & Description
Sketch: A visual mockup showing layout and components (hand-drawn or software-generated). Save it as img/sketch.png and embed it in your proposal markdown file (e.g., ![Sketch](../img/sketch.png)).
Description: High-level explanation of interface components and interactions (landing page, filters, charts).
